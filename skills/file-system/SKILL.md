# File System Skill

This skill allows the agent to interact with the local file system within the allowed workspace.
It handles both standard file operations and Office document processing.

## Capabilities

### General File Operations
1. **List Files**: Explore the directory structure.
2. **Read Files**: Read content of files. Automatically detects and reads text, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, and PDF files.
3. **Rename Files**: Rename or move files.
4. **Delete Files**: Delete files or empty directories (requires confirmation).

### Office Suite Operations
1. **Word (DOCX)**: Read text from documents and create/write new documents.
2. **PowerPoint (PPTX)**: Read text from slides and create new presentations.
3. **Excel (XLSX)**: Read data from sheets and write data to new or existing sheets.
4. **PDF**: Read text from PDF files.

## Usage Guidelines
- **Safety First**: Always check if a file exists using `list_files` before trying to read it.
- **Sandboxed**: You can only access files within the user-selected workspace (unless God Mode is active).
- **Pathing**: Use relative paths (e.g., `data.csv` or `subdir/config.json`).
- **Dependencies**: Office operations require `python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `openpyxl`, `pypdf`.
